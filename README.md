<h1>Weather Analysis and Visualization</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
Weather analysis and visualization is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location.
Everyone is affected adversely by natural calamities such as storm, cyclones etc. 
<br>
In this modern era, where the weather is continuously changing due to factor like global warming, it is very important to get accurate weather
prediction. 
<br>
This project aims to implement weather data analysis and visualization using web scraping in python programing language. The project is designed in such a way that it can present data in user friendly and
comprehensible graphical formats and plots. Here this system will predict
weather based on parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind. This
project can help many important sectors like tourism, water resources, Air
Traffic, Marine, Agriculture, Military, and Navy etc.
